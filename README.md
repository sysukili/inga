A R package for causal inference in survival analysis.The name “inga”
comes from the Japanese word 「因果(いんが)」,which means cause and
effect.

The goal of inga is to provide causal methods for survival
analysis(Hernan and Robins, n.d.) and reproduce the code from the book
“First Course in Causal Inference”.(Ding, n.d.)

## Installation

You can install the development version of inga from
[GitHub](https://github.com/sysukili/inga) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sysukili/inga")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(inga)
## basic example code
